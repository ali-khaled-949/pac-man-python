Overview
The objective of this project is to create a clone of the classic arcade game Pac-Man. The game will be developed using Python and the Pygame library, ensuring it runs on most desktop environments. This project aims to replicate the core gameplay mechanics of the original game, providing a nostalgic experience for players.

Features
In this game, you guide Pac-Man through a maze to eat all the dots while avoiding ghosts. Eating dots scores points, and clearing the maze of dots takes you to the next level. Some special dots let Pac-Man turn the tables and chase the ghosts for a short time, adding a fun twist. The game gets faster and more challenging as you progress, testing your quick thinking and reflexes.
